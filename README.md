# dynamic-speed-limiter
A system to dynamically alter speed-limits in metropolitan/suburban areas

// 1. Implement python sk-learn machine learning with 2016 NYC Real Time Traffic Data - https://www.kaggle.com/crailtap/nyc-real-time-traffic-speed-data-feed
and speed camera violations (either use made up data or Speed Camera Violations in Chicago, 2014 - 2016 https://www.kaggle.com/crailtap/nyc-real-time-traffic-speed-data-feed) to predict proper speed limit.

ALSO USE TIME, SEASON, CONDITIONS ETC

2016 NYC Real Time Traffic Data - Use and combine all data into one centralised excel or .csv file - use only "speed", "traveltime", "date-as-of" 
Speed Camera Violations in Chicago, 2014 - 2016 - Use "Camera ID", "Violations", "Violation Date"
Extras - Season (0 = Winter, 1 = Summer, 2 = Fall, 3 = Spring)

// 2. Factor in congestion ml
